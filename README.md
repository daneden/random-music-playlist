# “Play Random Playlist” macOS Service

This AppleScript service will pick a random playlist from Apple Music, begin playing it, and show it in the main window.

## Installation

Download this repo as a .zip and double-click the “Play Random Playlist” file to install it as a service.

You’ll also have the option to assign a keyboard shortcut. ⌘⇧R works well since it doesn’t have any associated command in Music.app.
